# Admin Combines Enhancement

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive enhancements made to the admin combines functionality for better registration management. The enhancements address issues with cancelled registration counting and provide powerful admin tools for registration oversight.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Registration Counting Problems

- **Issue**: Cancelled registrations were still being counted in total registration counts via `_count.registrations`
- **Solution**: Enhanced count displays to distinguish between active registrations (`registered_spots`) and total registrations (`_count.registrations`)

### 2. Limited Admin Control

- **Issue**: No admin functionality existed to permanently remove registrations
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive registration removal and management capabilities

### 3. Poor Registration Visibility

- **Issue**: Limited visibility into registration status breakdown and statistics
- **Solution**: Added registration statistics, status breakdown, and enhanced filtering

## New API Endpoints

### 1. Remove Registration (`removeRegistration`)

```typescript
removeRegistration: adminProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    registration_id: z.string().uuid(),
  }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { ... })
```

**Features:**

- Admin-only access with proper authorization
- Permanent deletion of registrations with database transaction safety
- Automatically adjusts spot counts only if registration wasn't already cancelled
- Returns success confirmation with registration details

**Usage:**

```typescript
const removeRegistrationMutation = api.combines.removeRegistration.useMutation({
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    toast({
      title: "Success",
      description: "Registration removed successfully!",
    });
    // Auto-refresh data
  },
});
```

### 2. Get Registration Statistics (`getRegistrationStats`)

```typescript
getRegistrationStats: adminProcedure
  .input(z.object({ combine_id: z.string().uuid() }))
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => { ... })
```

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  PENDING?: number;
  CONFIRMED?: number;
  WAITLISTED?: number;
  DECLINED?: number;
  CANCELLED?: number;
  activeRegistrations: number;
  totalRegistrations: number;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Admin Combines Query (`getAllForAdmin`)

- Extended existing endpoint with better registration data
- Includes both `_count.registrations` (total) and `registered_spots` (active)
- Enhanced filtering and search capabilities

## Frontend Enhancements

### 1. Registration Status Badges

Enhanced visual indicators for registration statuses:

```typescript
const getStatusColor = (status: RegistrationStatus) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "CONFIRMED":
      return "bg-green-600 text-white";
    case "PENDING":
      return "bg-yellow-600 text-white";
    case "DECLINED":
      return "bg-red-600 text-white";
    case "CANCELLED":
      return "bg-gray-600 text-gray-200 line-through";
    case "WAITLISTED":
      return "bg-orange-600 text-white";
    default:
      return "bg-gray-600 text-white";
  }
};
```

**Visual Features:**

- Color-coded status badges (green, yellow, red, gray, orange)
- Cancelled registrations shown with strikethrough styling
- Consistent visual language across the interface

### 2. Enhanced Registration Count Display

```typescript
{
  (() => {
    const activeCount = combine.registered_spots ?? 0;
    const totalCount = combine._count.registrations;
    if (activeCount !== totalCount) {
      return `${activeCount}/${combine.max_spots} active (${totalCount} total)`;
    }
    return `${activeCount}/${combine.max_spots} registered`;
  })();
}
```

**Format Examples:**

- When counts match: "24/32 registered"
- When counts differ: "20/32 active (24 total)"

### 3. Registration Overview Dashboard

Enhanced statistics panel with 6 key metrics:

1. **Total Combines**: Total number of combines in system
2. **Registration Open**: Combines currently accepting registrations
3. **Upcoming**: Combines scheduled but not yet open
4. **Active Registrations**: Sum of all `registered_spots` across combines
5. **Total Registrations**: Sum of all registrations (including cancelled)
6. **Filtered Results**: Number of combines matching current filters

### 4. Advanced Filtering

Extended filter options include:

- Search (title, description, location)
- Game type
- Combine status
- Event type (Online, In-Person, Hybrid)
- Year
- **New**: Registration Status Filter
  - ðŸŸ¡ Pending
  - ðŸŸ¢ Confirmed
  - ðŸŸ  Waitlisted
  - ðŸ”´ Declined
  - âš« Cancelled

### 5. Registration Management Actions

Enhanced dropdown menu for each registration:

**Status Change Actions:**

- Accept Registration (PENDING â†’ CONFIRMED)
- Move to Waitlist (PENDING/CONFIRMED â†’ WAITLISTED)
- Decline Registration
- Promote from Waitlist (WAITLISTED â†’ CONFIRMED)

**Administrative Actions:**

- Copy player email
- View full player profile
- **New**: Remove registration (with confirmation dialog)

**Confirmation Dialog:**

```typescript
const handleRemoveRegistration = (
  registrationId: string,
  playerName?: string,
) => {
  if (
    confirm(
      `Are you sure you want to remove ${playerName ? `${playerName}'s` : "this"} registration? This action cannot be undone.`,
    )
  ) {
    removeRegistrationMutation.mutate({ registration_id: registrationId });
  }
};
```

## Enhanced User Experience

### 1. Real-time Feedback

- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states during operations
- Auto-refresh after mutations
- Output panel with operation details

### 2. Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages
- Graceful degradation for failed operations
- User-friendly error display in output panel

### 3. Data Integrity

- Transaction-based operations
- Proper authorization checks
- Validation at both frontend and backend levels

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authorization

- All admin endpoints require `adminProcedure`
- User authorization verified at API level
- Frontend guards against unauthorized access

### 2. Data Validation

- UUID validation for all IDs
- Status enum validation
- Input sanitization and validation

### 3. Audit Trail

- Operation logging in output panel
- Success/failure tracking
- Timestamp recording for all operations

## TypeScript Types

### Registration Status Enum

```typescript
type RegistrationStatus =
  | "PENDING"
  | "CONFIRMED"
  | "WAITLISTED"
  | "DECLINED"
  | "CANCELLED";
```

### Registration Statistics

```typescript
type RegistrationStats = {
  PENDING?: number;
  CONFIRMED?: number;
  WAITLISTED?: number;
  DECLINED?: number;
  CANCELLED?: number;
  activeRegistrations: number;
  totalRegistrations: number;
};
```

### Enhanced Registration Type

```typescript
type Registration = {
  id: string;
  status: RegistrationStatus;
  qualified: boolean | null;
  registered_at: Date;
  player: {
    id: string;
    first_name: string;
    last_name: string;
    username: string | null;
    email: string;
    image_url: string | null;
  };
};
```
