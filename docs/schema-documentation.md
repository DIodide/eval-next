## Overview

The EVAL Gaming Platform database is organized into several key functional areas:

- **User Management**: Player and Coach profiles with Clerk authentication
- **Educational Institutions**: School management and associations
- **Gaming Profiles**: Game-specific player profiles and statistics
- **Competition**: Teams, tournaments, leagues, and rankings
- **Events**: Tryouts and combines for recruitment
- **Communication**: Messaging system between coaches and players
- **Performance**: Statistics and ranking systems

## API Architecture

The EVAL Gaming Platform uses a structured tRPC-based API with role-based access control through custom procedures.

### Procedure Types

#### `publicProcedure`

- **Access**: No authentication required
- **Use Cases**: Browsing public content, viewing tryouts/combines, general information
- **Context**: Basic request context only

#### `protectedProcedure`

- **Access**: Authenticated users only
- **Verification**: Clerk authentication
- **Context**: Includes `auth` object with user information

#### `playerProcedure`

- **Access**: Authenticated players only
- **Verification**:
  - Clerk authentication
  - Valid player profile in database
- **Context**: Includes `playerId` automatically
- **Use Cases**: Player registrations, dashboard views, profile management

```typescript
// Example usage
getPlayerRegistrations: playerProcedure
  .input(z.object({ status: z.enum(["upcoming", "past", "all"]) }))
  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    const { playerId } = ctx; // Automatically available
    // Query player's data
  });
```

#### `onboardedCoachProcedure`

- **Access**: Fully onboarded coaches only
- **Verification**:
  - Clerk authentication
  - `publicMetadata.onboarded === true`
  - `publicMetadata.userType === "coach"`
  - Valid coach profile in database
- **Context**: Includes `coachId` and `schoolId` automatically
- **Use Cases**: Managing tryouts/combines, player applications, administrative functions

```typescript
// Example usage
createTryout: onboardedCoachProcedure
  .input(tryoutCreationSchema)
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
    const { coachId, schoolId } = ctx; // Automatically available
    // Create tryout with proper associations
  });
```

#### `coachProcedure` (Available but Limited Use)

- **Access**: Any authenticated coach
- **Verification**: Clerk authentication + coach profile
- **Context**: Includes `coachId` and `schoolId`
- **Use Cases**: Basic coach operations that don't require full onboarding

### Authorization Levels

1. **Public Access**: General browsing, viewing published content
2. **Player Access**: Registration management, personal dashboard
3. **Regular Coach Access**: Basic profile management only
4. **Onboarded Coach Access**: Full administrative capabilities
   - Creating and managing events
   - Player recruitment and communication
   - Application review and status updates
   - School-associated operations

### Middleware Architecture

```typescript
// Authentication flow
protectedProcedure // Base authentication
  .use(isPlayer) // Player verification middleware
  // OR
  .use(isOnboardedCoach); // Onboarded coach verification middleware
```

The middleware system provides:

- **Automatic context enhancement**: Role-specific data available in context
- **Database verification**: Ensures profiles exist and are valid
- **Error handling**: Consistent error responses for authorization failures
- **Type safety**: TypeScript ensures correct context usage

### Security Features

- **Role-based Access Control**: Strict separation of player and coach capabilities
- **Resource Ownership**: Automatic verification of resource ownership
- **Onboarding Requirements**: Critical operations require completed onboarding
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in tRPC middleware support

## Database Configuration

```prisma
generator client {
    provider      = "prisma-client-js"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}

datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration
- **UUID Generation**: PostgreSQL native `gen_random_uuid()`

- Foreign key relationships are automatically indexed

### Performance Indexes

```prisma
// Player model indexes
@@index([school_id])
@@index([main_game_id])
@@index([class_year])
@@index([created_at])
@@index([location])

// Tryout model indexes
@@index([date])
@@index([status])
@@index([game_id])

// Message model indexes
@@index([conversation_id])
@@index([sent_at])
@@index([sender_id])
```

### Unique Constraints

- Player: `clerk_id`, `email`, `username`
- Coach: `clerk_id`, `email`, `username`
- School: Composite unique on `[name, type, state]`
- Game: `name`, `short_name`

## Data Flow Examples

### Player Registration Flow

1. Player signs up through Clerk authentication
2. Player model created with `clerk_id` reference
3. Player completes profile with academic information
4. Player creates game-specific profiles
5. Player can register for tryouts and combines

### Coach Onboarding Flow

1. Coach signs up through Clerk authentication
2. Coach model created with basic information
3. Coach submits `SchoolAssociationRequest`
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects request
5. Approved coach gains access to school resources
6. Coach can create teams, tryouts, and message players

### Tryout Management Flow

1. Coach creates tryout event (DRAFT status)
2. Coach configures requirements and details
3. Tryout published (PUBLISHED status)
4. Players register through `TryoutRegistration`
5. Coach manages registrations and selections
6. Event completed with results tracking

### Messaging Flow

1. Coach discovers player through search
2. Coach favorites player for tracking
3. Coach initiates conversation
4. Messages exchanged through `Conversation` and `Message` models
5. Read/unread status tracked for both parties

### Performance Tracking Flow

1. Player participates in combines/leagues
2. Performance data recorded in game profiles
3. EVAL composite scores calculated and updated
4. Rankings updated across multiple categories
5. Historical performance preserved for analysis

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- PII fields properly managed according to privacy regulations
- Academic transcripts stored as secure file references

### Access Control

- School associations verified through admin approval
- Coaches can only access players within their scope
- Player data visibility controlled by privacy settings

### Authentication

- Clerk integration provides secure authentication
- External account connections managed through Clerk
- Session management handled by Clerk infrastructure

## Migration and Maintenance

### Schema Evolution

- Use Prisma migrations for schema changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Test migrations thoroughly in staging environment

### Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
- Enum values provide data consistency
- Required fields prevent incomplete records

### Performance Monitoring

- Regular index analysis and optimization
- Query performance monitoring
- Database connection pooling optimization

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

- Additional game support
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile application support
- Real-time features (live scoring, chat)

### Scalability

- Database sharding strategies for growth
- Read replica configuration for performance
- Caching layer implementation
- API rate limiting and optimization

This schema provides a robust foundation for the EVAL Gaming Platform, supporting comprehensive esports recruitment, competition management, and performance tracking while maintaining flexibility for future growth and enhancement.
