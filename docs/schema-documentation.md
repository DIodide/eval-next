## Database Configuration

```prisma
generator client {
    provider      = "prisma-client-js"
    binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}

datasource db {
    provider  = "postgresql"
    url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
    directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

- **Database**: PostgreSQL

2. Coach model created with basic information
3. Coach submits `SchoolAssociationRequest`
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects request
5. Approved coach gains access to school resources
6. Coach can create teams, tryouts, and message players

### Tryout Management Flow

1. Coach creates tryout event (DRAFT status)
2. Coach configures requirements and details
3. Tryout published (PUBLISHED status)
4. Players register through `TryoutRegistration`
5. Coach manages registrations and selections
6. Event completed with results tracking

### Messaging Flow

1. Coach discovers player through search
2. Coach favorites player for tracking
3. Coach initiates conversation
4. Messages exchanged through `Conversation` and `Message` models
5. Read/unread status tracked for both parties

### Performance Tracking Flow

1. Player participates in combines/leagues
2. Performance data recorded in game profiles
3. EVAL composite scores calculated and updated
4. Rankings updated across multiple categories
5. Historical performance preserved for analysis

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Protection

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- PII fields properly managed according to privacy regulations
- Academic transcripts stored as secure file references

### Access Control

- School associations verified through admin approval
- Coaches can only access players within their scope
- Player data visibility controlled by privacy settings

### Authentication

- Clerk integration provides secure authentication
- External account connections managed through Clerk
- Session management handled by Clerk infrastructure

## Migration and Maintenance

### Schema Evolution

- Use Prisma migrations for schema changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Test migrations thoroughly in staging environment

### Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
- Enum values provide data consistency
- Required fields prevent incomplete records

### Performance Monitoring

- Regular index analysis and optimization
- Query performance monitoring
- Database connection pooling optimization

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements

- Additional game support
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile application support
- Real-time features (live scoring, chat)

### Scalability

- Database sharding strategies for growth
- Read replica configuration for performance
- Caching layer implementation
- API rate limiting and optimization

This schema provides a robust foundation for the EVAL Gaming Platform, supporting comprehensive esports recruitment, competition management, and performance tracking while maintaining flexibility for future growth and enhancement.
