      <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani">Welcome to EVAL, a platform for gamers to use their skills in esports to unlock college scholarships and achieve their dreams. Our mission is to help students get recognized for their work in the esports space. Whether you're a coach, parent, or student, we're here to help you understand the world of gaming.</p>

This is the first in a series of articles that will help you make the most of EVAL and find opportunities in esports. Let's get started with how to use EVAL!

## Step 1: Make a Profile, Tell a Story

Your profile is a lot more than just info about you - it influences how colleges, recruiters, and other players see you. It's a page all about you - your passion, achievements, and goals - so you should make the most of it.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-800/90 to-gray-900/90 border border-gray-700/50 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
  <h3 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold text-xl mb-6">Profile Setup Checklist</h3>
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
      <div className="w-6 h-6 bg-green-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 mt-1">
        <svg className="w-3 h-3 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M5 13l4 4L19 7" />
        </svg>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold">Add a Profile Picture</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani text-sm">In recruiting, colleges value seeing the player behind the screen. Coaches want to know you as a student just as much as a player, so adding a headshot can help add a level of personality to your profile.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
      <div className="w-6 h-6 bg-green-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 mt-1">
        <svg className="w-3 h-3 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M5 13l4 4L19 7" />
        </svg>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold">Fill Out Your Bio</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani text-sm">A key way to differentiate yourself is to fill out your profile to help coaches make decisions. Essential info—like age, grad year, region, school type, goals—helps coaches make decisions, and additional info like your academic interests, hobbies, and fun facts help scouts learn more about the person behind the player.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
      <div className="w-6 h-6 bg-green-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 mt-1">
        <svg className="w-3 h-3 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

        </svg>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold">Connect Your Games</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani text-sm">Coaches want to know if your skills stack up; there's no better way to do that than to link your game accounts to unlock EVAL stats. These stats can give coaches the big picture of your gameplay while providing you with crucial, actionable stats that can help you become a better player.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
      <div className="w-6 h-6 bg-green-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 mt-1">
        <svg className="w-3 h-3 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M5 13l4 4L19 7" />
        </svg>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold">Share, Share, Share!</h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani text-sm">Your profile helps people get to know you, so once you've filled it out, the best thing to do is share it. Copy the link and post it on social media platforms like Instagram, X, and Discord to let people know about your skills and get noticed!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Step 2: Link Your Stats, Level Up Your Game

In the process of setting up your account, you linked your game accounts to your EVAL profile. Linking your accounts to EVAL unlocks a whole new level of analytics, giving you elite data on your gameplay and, most importantly, your **EVAL Score**.

### Link Your Games

<GameConnectionsPanel />

### Your EVAL Analytics Dashboard

Once you link your accounts, you'll notice a new panel on your dashboard:

<GameAnalyticsPanel />
<div className="h-2 my-2"> </div>
This is the EVAL analytics panel, a place on your dashboard that gives you detailed stats on your most recent games. In this example, we used Valorant, but these dashboards are also available for Rocket League, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Overwatch 2.

Regardless of game, one thing appears on all of their stats: your **EVAL Score**.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500/10 to-pink-500/10 border border-purple-500/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
  <div className="flex items-start gap-4">
    <div className="w-8 h-8 bg-purple-500 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center flex-shrink-0 mt-1">
      <svg className="w-4 h-4 text-white" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M13 16h-1v-4h-1m1-4h.01M21 12a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z" />
      </svg>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-white font-orbitron font-bold text-lg mb-2">What is EVAL Score?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-300 font-rajdhani">The EVAL Score is a metric, scaled from 0 to 100, that summarizes your skills in a single glance. We use a unique algorithm that draws from your in-game stats to assign you a score at a glance. The EVAL Score allows you to determine your skill, showcase yourself to other players and recruiters, and qualify for EVAL Championship Combines.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Get Your Numbers Up

You have your EVAL Score now, so what's the next step? **Playing more games, of course!** Playing more lets you increase your EVAL score by focusing on areas where you fall short. Winning is important, of course, but more valuable are good game habits.

## Step 3: Play in Combines and Talk to Coaches

Now that your profile and stats are set up, it's time to tap into the EVAL community! By making an account, you've gained access to a host of tournaments, recruiting tools, and our community of esports experts.

### Get Ranked with Combines

EVAL Combines are the best way to get ranked on the EVAL platform and get noticed by college recruiters. These events are Swiss-style tournaments that offer you the chance to demonstrate your abilities alongside a variety of teammates.

Participating in combines offers several key benefits:

- **Increase Your EVAL Score**: Strong combine performance directly impacts your ranking
- **Earn Badges**: Unlock special achievements for your profile that showcase your skills
- **Win Scholarships**: Championship combines offer scholarship money and gear prizes

These tournaments are designed to showcase your abilities in a competitive environment while providing valuable ranking data that colleges can use to evaluate potential recruits.

### Learn About College Programs

College esports is a rather new space, and we understand that it may be difficult to find the most up-to-date information about programs at various schools. That's where EVAL comes in: through our messaging feature, you can send messages straight to coaches that let you learn more about college esports, their programs, and even discuss recruitment and scholarship opportunities.

There are several ways to connect with coaches and learn about programs:

- **Direct Messaging**: Send messages straight to coaches through school profile pages
- **School Applications**: Apply directly to esports programs through our platform
- **Discord Support**: Ask questions and get answered by coaches and recruiting experts
- **College Profiles**: Browse detailed information about esports programs at various schools

You can contact coaches by going to their school profile and accessing their contact information or asking questions in our Discord, where you'll be answered by coaches and recruiting experts.
